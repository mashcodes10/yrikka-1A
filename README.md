# YRIKKA 1A - Bridging the Synthetic to Real Data Gap

## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program in collaboration with the host company YRIKKA. The focus of the project was to address the synthetic-to-real (syn2real) data gap in object detection, where models trained on synthetic data often struggle on real-world images. We used a YOLO-based object detection model to detect five everyday objects: potted plant, chair, cup, vase, and book. The model’s performance was evaluated on synthetic data with intentionally noisy or missing annotations to better reflect real-world labeling challenges. Labels were corrected using CVAT, and model behavior was analyzed using a set of challenging real-world test images. New synthetic data was then generated using YRIKKA’s engine to refine the model and improve its real-world performance.

## 🎯 **Project Highlights**

- Developed a YOLO-based object detection model to study the synthetic-to-real data gap in detecting everyday objects.
- Evaluated model performance using noisy and corrected synthetic labels, showing how label quality affects real-world results.
- Used CVAT for label correction and YRIKKA’s synthetic data engine to improve training data and model reliability.

### Project Goals

Bridging the synthetic-to-real (syn2real) data gap in object detection:  
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and localizing objects in images
- **Contextual Understanding**: Leveraging scene context, lighting, and occlusion information
- **Multi-label Classification**: Handling images with multiple objects
- **Robust Recognition**: Working with various lighting conditions and occlusions
- Improve YOLO’s mAP@50 by +0.10 over the baseline model

## 📊 **Data Exploration**

### Dataset Structure

We have two BTT datasets with comprehensive contextual annotations:

#### Dataset 1: `852a64c6-4bd3-495f-8ff7-f5cc85e34316`
- **Images**: 497 PNG files
- **Annotations**: COCO format JSON with contextual metadata
- **Categories**: 10 object classes

#### Dataset 2: `8e0a5d2d-3ae0-4ff0-b6ee-2d85f7da4fee`
- **Images**: 496 PNG files  
- **Annotations**: COCO format JSON with contextual metadata
- **Categories**: 10 object classes

### Object Categories

The datasets include the following object categories:
- **Chair** - Furniture seating
- **Potted Plant** - Plants in containers
- **Cup** - Drinking vessels
- **Vase** - Decorative containers
- **Book** - Reading materials
- **Pot** - Cooking/storage containers

### Contextual Information

Each image includes rich contextual metadata:

### Context Types
- **Scene**: Environment type (indoor living room, outdoor garden, kitchen, library, etc.)
- **Lighting Conditions**: bright lighting, backlit, spotlight, etc.
- **Blur Effect**: background blur, motion blur, or not specified
- **Occlusion**: object visibility (covered with cloth, behind translucent screen, shadows, etc.)
- **Object Classes**: List of detected objects in the image

### Sample Data Structure
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "file_name": "example_image.png",
    "labels": ["chair", "cup", "potted plant"],
    "contexts": {
        "blur effect": ["background blur"],
        "scene": ["indoor living room"],
        "occlusion": ["covered with a cloth"],
        "object classes": ["chair", "cup", "potted plant"],
        "lighting conditions": ["bright lighting"]
    }
}
```
